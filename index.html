        <h2>Social entrepreneur and programmer</h2>
        <p >I disliked programming courses during my engineering studies. I regretted not being a doctor to help people and have a meaningful job. But impacting can take so many forms. I realize now how programming is definitely one of them, with such a huge potential ahead.

              <p class='book-description'>
              Why do the poor borrow to save? Why do they miss out on free life-saving immunizations, but pay for unnecessary drugs? In Poor Economics, Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, two award-winning MIT professors, answer these questions based on years of field research from around the world. Called "marvelous, rewarding" by the Wall Street Journal, the book offers a radical rethinking of the economics of poverty and an intimate view of life on 99 cents a day. Poor Economics shows that creating a world without poverty begins with understanding the daily decisions facing the poor
