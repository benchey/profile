        <h2>Social entrepreneur and programmer</h2>
        <p >I disliked programming courses during my engineering studies. I regretted not being a doctor to help people and have a meaningful job. But impacting can take so many forms. I realize now how programming is definitely one of them, with such a huge potential ahead.

               <h3 class='book-author'>Vladimir Bartol</h3>
               <p class='book-description'>
                 Alamut takes place in 11th Century Persia, in the fortress of Alamut, where self-proclaimed prophet Hasan ibn Sabbah is setting up his mad but brilliant plan to rule the region with a handful elite fighters who are to become his "living daggers." By creating a virtual paradise at Alamut, filled with beautiful women, lush gardens, wine and hashish, Sabbah is able to convince his young fighters that they can reach paradise if they follow his commands. With parallels to Osama bin Laden, Alamut tells the story of how Sabbah was able to instill fear into the ruling class by creating a small army of devotees who were willing to kill, and be killed, in order to achieve paradise. Believing in the supreme Ismaili motto “Nothing is true, everything is permitted,” Sabbah wanted to “experiment” with how far he could manipulate religious devotion for his own political gain through appealing to what he called the stupidity and gullibility of people and their passion for pleasure and selfish desires.

              <p class='book-description'>
              Why do the poor borrow to save? Why do they miss out on free life-saving immunizations, but pay for unnecessary drugs? In Poor Economics, Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, two award-winning MIT professors, answer these questions based on years of field research from around the world. Called "marvelous, rewarding" by the Wall Street Journal, the book offers a radical rethinking of the economics of poverty and an intimate view of life on 99 cents a day. Poor Economics shows that creating a world without poverty begins with understanding the daily decisions facing the poor

              <p class='book-description'>
                What do we know about the essential Islam of Rumi, Al Halladj, Ibn Arabi, Iqbal, Sufi brotherhoods, philosophers and scholars who have brought so much to the medieval West, the one who nourished the art and literature of a whole civilization?
                Facing the current confusion and worry, Eva de Vitray-Meyerovitch introduces us to the mystical foundations of this religion to which the bulk of her academic research and her work as a translator is devoted. Early converted to Islam, the French intellectual helps us penetrate to the heart of a universe where love and prayer take the first place.
